# PatchingAndBuildingLinuxKernel
Guide on how to patch and build the Linux kernel for the T2 Mackbook.

# Preamble
This is a quick tutorial on how to patch and compile the linux kernel.

As an example we will be using aunali1's patches for the T2 macbooks and we will use the linux kernel version 5.10.12

This can be pretty much used for other situations, this is not specific for macbooks, this can be used to apply patches and compile kernels for other devices.

## Why are we doing this?
No particular reason apart from the fact of running a more recent kernel that has less issues and works as good as the 5.7.19 kernel (which has been the golden version untill last week)

## What does this tutorial assume?
- Some familiarity with linux;
- you want to patch the kernel for a T2 macbook pro;
- you want to compile the kernel;
(Again as said above this can be used as a general guideline for other kernels patches and devices)
